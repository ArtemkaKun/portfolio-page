<main>
    <p>Hi, my name is Artem, I'm 22 years old and I like programming and everything related to it.</p>
    <p>I'm mostly interested in game development and backend stuff. Besides that, I also play computer games, watch post-apocalyptic movies and try to socialize.</p>
    <p></p>
    Currently I:

    <ul>
        <li>interested in <a href="https://vlang.io/" target="_blank">V</a></li>
        <li>work in <a href="https://4experience.co/" target="_blank">4Experience</a> as a Unity Developer</li>
        <li>on my way to move away from the Unity game engine</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I started my way as a programmer by creating a simple text-based RPG in Python back in 2016. Then, I learned the basics of HTML/CSS from courses on <a href="https://htmlacademy.org/" target="_blank">htmlacademy.org</a></p>
    <p>I don't really have a big interest in it, because I mostly want to make games, so I switched on Unity3D. With it, I started to learn the C# programming language. I also have episodes of Java and JS stuff but don't like them both.</p>
    <p>I actually like to learn new programming languages the whole time, list of languages I have tried already:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>V</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>Rust</li>
        <li>Go</li>
        <li>Dart</li>
        <li>F#</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Crystal</li>
        <li>Julia</li>
        <li>R</li>
        <li>Bash</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For now, the main languages I use every day are C# and V. I like V because of the simplicity, innovations, and power of this language, and C# because of its maturity and codebase. In the future, I want to spend some time learning Rust and Dart,
        since I believe these are programming languages of the future.</p>

    <p>When I first come up with programming, I used to not care about open source. But for the last 2 years, I become a huge fan of it. I'm sure that open-source spread the best ideas about how good software actually should be done.
        All my pet projects are open source and can be found on my GitHub. Besides, I have also understood (only a bit) a "kung-fu" of contributing, so now I'm trying to be an active member of the V language community - not only from the programming side
        but also from the community part of a project.</p>

    <p>With feelings for open-source, I also found that I like Linux too. Previously this was only a "hack box" for me, that crashes continuously and just was my workshop for experiments. Today things look differently - for more than a year already
        I have been using Garuda Linux as my main (and only) OS on a computer and I'm very happy with it. I have never ever developed on (and for) Linux-based systems professionally, so I'm very enthusiastic if I can find a job that will allow me to develop
        on OS I like and support.</p>
